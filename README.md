# Natural-language-processing
 Natural language processing is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

# Prerequisites:
1. _Python 3.6+_
2. _Anaconda Distribution 5.2+_
3. _NLTK Toolkit 3.3+_
### Some hardware requirements should also be fulfilled to run this project smoothly:
1. _At least 8GB RAM_
2. _At least 50GB of usable Hard Disk space_

# Tasks in NLP:
1. Tokenization
2. Stopword Removal
3. N-Gram (common word identification)
4. Word sense disambiguity
5. Parts-of-speech
6. Stemming (removing ends of words)

# Usage:
- First, download the project as a zip archive and extract it to your desired location or just clone the repository. 
- Download the dataset using the link provided in the [Restaurant_Reviews.tsv](https://github.com/charitha-madala/Natural-language-processing/blob/master/NLP.py) within the datasets directory. Move the downloaded dataset or whichever dataset you want to use into the datasets directory. In case you are using your dataset, you have to modify the filenames in [NLP.py](https://github.com/charitha-madala/Natural-language-processing/blob/master/NLP.py) to the one you'll be using. Set the path in spyder to your where your dataset is stored.
- You need to execute the python file to run this project. 
- Read the steps carefully before you do so.  
- All these will generate a  pickled file as a result of the first execution. After the first execution, you should be able to execute the driver code in the end(uncomment it and run trials).
